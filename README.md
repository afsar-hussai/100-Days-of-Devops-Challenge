# 🚀 100 Days of DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my journey of mastering DevOps! I am documenting my daily learning, labs, and projects as I progress from a fresh graduate to a skilled DevOps Engineer.

## 🎯 Goal
To commit code, learn new concepts, and build projects every single day for 100 days. My focus includes **Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines**.
